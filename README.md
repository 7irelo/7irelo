## Projects

Here are some notable projects I've worked on:

- **Full Banking System**
  - **Architecture**: Built a full-fledged banking system composed of multiple Spring Framework services, each designed to handle different aspects of the banking process, including user management, account services, transactions, loans, cards, and customer support.
  - **Technologies**: Utilized Java 22 and Spring Boot to create modular services, with each service responsible for a specific domain. Integrated PostgreSQL for data persistence across most services, with Neo4j for the customer support service to leverage graph-based queries.
  - **Deployment**: Deployed the system using Kubernetes, ensuring scalability, resilience, and seamless management of microservices. Implemented Docker for containerization, allowing each service to be packaged independently and deployed in a cloud-native environment.
  - **Common Library**: Developed a common library to standardize PostgreSQL models and ensure consistent data handling across services, excluding the customer-support service, which uses its own Neo4j-based models.
  - **Achievements**: Successfully created a highly modular and scalable banking platform capable of supporting complex financial operations, secure data handling, and real-time customer support.

- **E-Commerce Platform**
  - Developed a scalable e-commerce platform using ASP.NET Core for the backend and React.js for the frontend. The platform utilizes PostgreSQL and MongoDB for database management and is designed for performance, security, and scalability.

- **Banking Mobile Application**
  - Built a cross-platform mobile banking application using React Native, providing a seamless user experience on both iOS and Android. This application integrates with backend APIs to enable secure financial transactions, account management, and real-time updates.

- **Social Media Mobile Application**
  - Developed a social media platform using React Native, offering users a dynamic and interactive experience on both iOS and Android. The app integrates with a Django backend to support features like user profiles, news feeds, messaging, and notifications.

- **Data Visualization Tool**
  - Designed a powerful data visualization tool using Ruby on Rails, enabling the creation of insightful visualizations from complex datasets. The tool supports various chart types and data manipulation features, allowing users to gain deep insights through a user-friendly interface.
